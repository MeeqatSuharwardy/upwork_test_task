## üéØ Benefits of Your Own OAuth Apps

‚úÖ **More reliable** - No dependency on Nango's shared app  
‚úÖ **Full control** - Customize scopes and permissions  
‚úÖ **Production ready** - Required for real deployments  
‚úÖ **Better debugging** - See your own app's activity in GitHub/Slack  
‚úÖ **No rate limits** - Not shared with other Nango users

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Redirect URI mismatch" error
- Double-check the callback URL is exactly: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
- No trailing slashes, no http (must be https)

### "Invalid client" error
- Verify you pasted the Client ID and Secret correctly
- Check for extra spaces or line breaks
- Regenerate the client secret and try again

### "Insufficient permissions" error
- Add the required scopes listed above
- If you already authorized, you may need to re-authorize to get new scopes

## üìù Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit OAuth credentials to Git**
- They're stored in Nango Dashboard, not in your code
- Your `.env` only contains Nango keys
- GitHub/Slack credentials stay in Nango

‚úÖ **Your `.env.local` is already in `.gitignore`**
‚úÖ **OAuth secrets are only in Nango Dashboard**

---

**After completing this setup, your "unknown_user_account" error should be resolved!** üéâ
